# Introduction

Hi, I'm MÃ¡rton, born in the '90s and a lifelong tinkerer.

Since childhood, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by mechanics and electronics. At the age of six, I disassembled an entire car with my father. While other kids were glued to cartoons, I was learning to weld, solder, and do basic woodworkingâ€”right alongside playing DOS games.

During my teenage years, I built all sorts of DIY creations, from custom hookahs and a homemade projector to camera stabilizers and more. Later, while studying mechanical engineering at university, I built a metal-melting foundry, cast my own parts, and even forged a sword. After a while, I felt I had explored enough of metalwork and shifted my focus to hardware programming, which I learned at Green Fox Academy.

Since then, Iâ€™ve been working on a wide range of projects that blend both hardware and software. I created this page to collect and share some of those works. There's still a lot that hasnâ€™t been documented yetâ€”and even more that's waiting to be uploadedâ€”so the collection will grow over time.

If youâ€™re curious about my professional background, feel free to check out my [CV](/cv) ðŸ“„
