### "Jack-of-all-trades master of none, but better than master of one."

This website is a personal hub where I share some of the projects I’ve been working on, along with a bit about who I am.

From hardware hacks and creative coding experiments to audiovisual installations and embedded systems—I enjoy exploring all kinds of tech.

Feel free to check out the [Projects](/projects) section to dive into the builds, or visit the [About](/about)  page to learn more about me and what drives my curiosity.
