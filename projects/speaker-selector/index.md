## Description
A friend of mine, who's an audiophile, ran into a bit of a hassleâ€”he owns three pairs of high-end speakers, each ideal for a different music genre. But every time he wants to switch genres, he has to manually swap speaker cables at his amplifier.
To solve this, I came up with an idea: an ESP8266-controlled relay switch that lets him easily switch between speaker pairs without touching a single cable.
The system has four independent stereo outputs, each controllable via dedicated buttons. Additionally, it hosts a small web interface on the local network for convenient remote control.
Source code can be found here: [EspSpeakerSelector](https://github.com/marcidelux/EspSpeakerSelector)

## Features:
- Remembers the selected speaker, SSID, and Wi-Fi password.
- Static webpage for setting up Wi-Fi credentials.
- Static webpage for controlling the relays.
- Built-in socket server for syncing the currently selected speaker across multiple clients.
